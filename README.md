### 🚀 Enterprise Big Data, Cloudera, AWS & Data Platform Engineering

I am a **Big Data Platform Leader** with 10+ years of experience driving Big Data modernization, governed data ecosystems, and secure analytics platforms across enterprise environments. I focus on delivering **high-availability, compliant, and scalable** data platforms while aligning engineering execution with organizational strategy.

I partner with engineering, architecture, security, and leadership teams to establish **platform standards, governance frameworks, and modernization roadmaps** that deliver measurable business impact.

---

## 🧭 Leadership & Strategy
- Led multi-team execution for large-scale **CDH → CDP migration** with zero business disruption
- Defined platform governance standards, lineage strategy, and security controls (Ranger, Atlas, Kerberos)
- Drove automation roadmap reducing operational load by **30–40%**
- Partnered with audit and risk teams ensuring **zero audit findings** across platforms
- Improved platform SLAs and service reliability through standardized operations and monitoring

---

## 📈 KPI-Based Impact Highlights
- **99.9% uptime** maintained across production clusters
- **25% cost reduction** achieved via YARN, Kafka, and resource tuning
- **2× performance improvement** on key analytical workloads
- **60% reduction** in manual operational tasks through automation
- Improved governance maturity with unified Ranger + Atlas deployment
